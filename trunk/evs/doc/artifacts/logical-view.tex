\subsection{Common}
\subsubsection{Marshaller}

The marshaller translates objects into sequences of bytes and vice versa.

\subsubsection{Interface Description}

The interface description is the source for generating the interface for client proxies and remote objects.

\subsubsection{Absolute Object Reference}

\subsubsection{Connection}

TCP connections are uniquely identified by the pair of communication end points.
TCP/IP end points are uniquely identified by their IP address and port number.

\subsection{Server}

\subsubsection{Remote Object}

\subsubsection{Invoker}

The invoker calls the marshaller to translate request messages to invocations.

\subsubsection{Server Request Handler}

The server request handler receives request messages and dispatches them to the invokers.
The server request handler sends response messages to the client request handlers.

\subsection{Protocols}

\subsubsection{Communication Protocols}

\paragraph{Minimal Communication Protocol}

The minimal communication protocol has no protocol header and therefore transmits byte streams without interpreting them.
The marshalling protocol is determined by the communication end points, which process only single protocols.
The sender and receiver are determined by the communication end points.

\paragraph{Typed Communication Protocol}

The typed communication protocol prefixes the message body with a 4 byte header, which specifies the protocol of the message body.
The sender and receiver are determined by the communication end points.

\subsubsection{Marshalling Protocols}

\paragraph{Binary Serialization Protocol}

The invocation is analysed and serialized via reflection.

\paragraph{Java Serialization Protocol}

The invocation is serialized by the default Java object serialization.

\paragraph{Axi2 Java Web Service Protocol}

The marshaller translates invocations to SOAP messages and vice versa.

\subsection{Configuration}

\subsubsection{Properties}
